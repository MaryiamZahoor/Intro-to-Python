# Computer Vision Project Declaration

Over the next four weeks, you will work on a computer vision project. This project involves selecting a task from key areas in computer vision: Classification, Detection, Segmentation, or pose detection.

## Selecting Your Project
Explore a range of project ideas to find one that resonates with your interests and aligns with the core computer vision tasks mentioned. For inspiration, refer to the "PROJECT IDEAS" document in this repository. Feel free to propose your unique ideas, but please consult with me for approval before proceeding.

## Dataset Creation
Your immediate task for this and the following week is to concentrate on creating and labeling a dataset tailored to your chosen project. 

Detailed guidelines for this week's assignment are attached in the "Assignment.docs" file.


We will go over two jupyter notebooks and one annotating tool,for this tutorial:

### Notebook for Understanding Image Datasets 

- We will Learn about different types of image datasets.
- Labelling formats for different tasks
- Visualize examples for each dataset type.
- Clean one of the dataset 

### Notebook for Introduction to YOLOv8

- Overview of the YOLO framework and its capabilities.
- Explore how YOLO performs various tasks like detection, pose estimation, classification, and segmentation.


### Annotating Datasets for YOLO

- Tools for annotation:
  - [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/)
  - [Makesense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/)
  - [VGG Image Annotator](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/)
- The detail description of tools is given in "Assignment.docs"  file.
