# Computer Vision Project: From Concept to Implementation

Welcome to our extensive project series in Computer Vision! This repository serves as your guide through the various stages of your project, from problem identification to working with YOLOv8. Below you'll find a structured approach to each part of the project.

## Project Overview

### Week 6: Introduction and Task Identification

#### 1. Identifying the Problem
- Choose a topic in computer vision that interests you.
- Align your problem with one of the following tasks:
  - Classification
  - Detection
  - Segmentation
  - Tracking

#### 2. Dataset Creation/Enhancement
- **Option 1 - Create New Data:**
  - Collect and assemble a dataset of images.
  - Ensure diversity and relevance to your chosen problem.
  - Aim for at least [specify number] images.

- **Option 2 - Annotate Existing Data:**
  - Choose an existing vision dataset.
  - Create new labels or annotations.
  - Annotate at least [specify number] images.

#### 3. Annotation Guidelines
- Define your labels or annotations clearly.
- For specific tasks, use appropriate annotation methods like bounding boxes or segmentation masks.

#### 4. Report Submission
- Document the following:
  - Your chosen problem and its significance.
  - Data sources and methodology for dataset creation or annotation.
  - Include dataset snippets (images and labels).
  - Discuss any challenges encountered.

#### 5. Project Ideas
- Explore example project ideas to inspire your work.

### Understanding Image Datasets

- Learn about different types of image datasets.
- Visualize examples for each dataset type.

### Introduction to YOLOv8

- Overview of the YOLO framework and its capabilities.
- Explore how YOLO performs various tasks like detection, pose estimation, classification, and segmentation.

### Annotating Datasets for YOLO

- Understand YOLO format for labels.
- Tools for annotation:
  - [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/)
  - [Makesense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/)
  - [VGG Image Annotator](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/)

### YOLOv8 Tutorial Notebook
